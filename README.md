Data Analysis Project: LayOffs Dataset

Many employees are facing layoffs every year. This project gives an idea on which country,company and industry face maximum layoffs.
Layoffs Dataset contains more than 2000 rows with colums such as company,location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,date,stage, country, and funds_raised.


While Exploring Data with SQL, I was working on the following things...

Checked all the details of table such column name, data types and constraints
Checked for duplicate values in table and deleted those rows.
Removed unwanted rows from table.
Replaced null values in date column.
Altered Data type of total_laid_off column.
