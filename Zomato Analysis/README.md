Zomato Data Exploration and Analysis with SQL (SQL SERVER)

Most of us know that Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company.
The idea of analysing the Zomato_dataset is to get the overview of what actutally is happening in their business. 
Zomato Dataset consist of more than 9000 rows with columns such as Restaurants_id, Restaurants_name, City, Location, Cuisines and many more...

While Exploring Data with SQL, I was working on the following things...

1.Checked all the details of table such column name, data types and constraints
2.Checked for duplicate values in [RestaurantId] column
3.Removed unwanted columns from table
4.Merged 2 differnt tables and added the new column of Country_Name with the help of primary key as [CountryCode] column
5.Identitfied and corrected the mis-spelled city names
6.Created new category column for rating
